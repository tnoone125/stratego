# project
Fall 2016 CS 3110 Project

An implementation of the board game Stratego for the final project of CS 3110: Functional Programming. Co-Authors: Aishwarya Rameshkumar (implemented UI), George Frentzel (implemented AI)

To play Stratego, enter 'make play'. This will build the game in runner.ml and launch it.
We recommend slightly increasing the terminal size, to around 100 columns.

To simply compile game.ml, ai.ml, main.ml, and runner.ml, enter 'make'

'make clean' will delete generated files produced by the make and build systems.

Implementation for Stratego is done entirely in game.ml, main.ml, ai.ml, and runner.ml (and their .mli files)
