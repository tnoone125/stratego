System Description:

We will implement the board game Stratego. The main features will be a one
player game (vs. the computer) and a two-person mode where each player hands off
the computer to the other player after the end of their turn.]

Architecture: We will use a shared data architecture. Each of the players 
has access to and edits the shared game board (which starts as a 2D array
all containing None.)

System Design:

Module Design:

Data: The primary data structure we will use is a full_piece option array array,
which is a 2D array where each position of the array refers to a full_piece
(or lack thereof). The primary functions move & attack each return updated boards.

External dependencies:

Testing plan: We may use unit tests to assure that in-game functionality works
properly (each piece correctly defeats or is defeated by another piece). 
After that, we will test the actual game engine simply by playing it. Once we
have verified that it works, we will add some corner case gameplay to unit 
tests.
